# Machiavellian a game of social intuition and deplomacy

Machiavellian is a project that I started to make myself more familiar with Ruby on rails as a full stack framework over just a backend api. At first I found some of the rails helper documentation difficult to follow but eventually started to enjoy how it worked. Machiavellian uses Rails 7.0.4. It uses bcrypt for password encryption. The CSS is supplied by tailwind. The site is supported using a postgresql database. To launch the app locally just navigate to the top directory and run bin/dev. Once you are in the app you can read the instructions on how to play
by clicking the link at the home screen. 

## Install
To try Machiavellian you will need to have npm to download the dependencies for the site. To install npm follow the following instructions:



To try a local copy of Machiavellian create a new directory and then navigate into it. Then in the software development environment of your choice (I use Visual Studio Code) type:
1. git init 
2. git remote origin https://github.com/jbrownofnj/Machiavellian
3. git pull origin public_git
4. npm install
5. bin/dev

# Live App
If you would like to see how to app runs when deployed there is a demo site here:
https://shark-app-due3j.ondigitalocean.app/
Once you log in and create a new user you will find you are already in a game. This is an example game with fake users. You can feel free to delete this game if you like. This game is meant to be played in person with 6-10 friends using your phones to access the site as a game tool.
